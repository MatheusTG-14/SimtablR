# Changelog

## SimtablR 3.1.0

### New features

- [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  gains `big_mark` and `decimal_mark` to control how numbers are written
  in the rendered table (print,
  [`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html),
  [`as_gt()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/as_gt.md),
  `as_flextable()`). For example `tb(data, x, y, big_mark = ",")`
  renders `4391.2` as `4,391.2`, and
  `big_mark = ".", decimal_mark = ","` gives the `4.391,2` convention
  used in many locales. Defaults (`""` / `"."`) reproduce the previous
  output exactly. Both are also reachable on a computed result through
  `fmt(result, big_mark = ..., decimal_mark = ...)`; raw evidence in
  `$data` is never reformatted.
- [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md)
  gains `d` (decimal places for the rendered table) and `percent` (show
  sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, and prevalence
  as percentages).
  [`roc()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/roc.md)
  gains the same `d` and `percent` switches for its cutpoint proportion
  columns. `percent` defaults to `TRUE` and `d` to `2`; pass
  `percent = FALSE` for decimal proportions. Both are also reachable on
  a computed result through `fmt(result, d = ..., percent = ...)`; raw
  evidence in `$data` is never rounded or scaled.
- Likelihood ratios from
  [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md)
  now carry asymptotic log-method confidence intervals (Simel et
  al. 1991; Altman 2000), computed from the Katz ratio-of-proportions
  standard error. The interval is `NA` when any confusion-matrix cell is
  zero; the point estimate is unchanged.
- [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md)
  results add Cohen’s kappa for index-test / reference-standard
  agreement, with a Fleiss, Cohen & Everitt (1969) large-sample
  confidence interval.

### Breaking changes

#### Downscale (September 2026)

SimtablR 3.1 narrows its surface to the core table, regression,
diagnostic, and reporting workflow. None of these functions shipped in a
CRAN release.

- Removed `km()` and the Kaplan-Meier engine. Use
  [`survival::survfit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html)
  directly;
  [`survtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/survtab.md)
  still covers Cox models.
- Removed `stdtab()`/`standardize()` (marginal standardization),
  `additive_interaction()`, and `subgroups()`.
- Removed `sampling_weights()` and the `weights` argument of
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  and [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md).
  Use the `survey` package directly for weighted analyses.
- Removed `regtab(method = "clogit")` and its `strata` argument. Fit
  matched case-control models with
  [`survival::clogit()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/clogit.html).
- Removed the recode helpers `bin()`, `lump_levels()`,
  `make_missing_explicit()`, and `set_reference()`. Use base R or
  `forcats` before analysis; reference levels can also be set with
  `ref =`.
- Removed `patch()`, `add_pvalue()`, `plot_export_dim()`, and
  `simtab_report_skeleton()`; `simtab_theme()` is now internal. Use
  [`test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/test.md)
  on a result instead of `add_pvalue()`.
- `check()` and `audit()` are replaced by
  `advise(result, audit = TRUE)`.
- [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  renames `stat.cont` to `summary` (matching
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md))
  and drops `fast`, `format`, `paired`, and `p.adjust`.
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  drops `p.adjust`, `paired`, and `smd`. Set those options on the result
  with
  [`test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/test.md),
  e.g. `table1(...) |> test(p.adjust = "holm", smd = TRUE)`. When
  [`test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/test.md)
  is given only these options, it keeps the existing test choice.
- [`roc()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/roc.md)
  drops the `ci` argument (DeLong intervals only) and the
  `"closest.topleft"` cutpoint.
- [`export_xlsx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_xlsx.md)
  drops `sheet`, `machine_sheet`, and `dict_sheet`; sheets are always
  named `machine-readable`, `display`, and `data-dictionary`.
- Study designs accept only their canonical names (`cross_sectional`,
  `cohort`, `case_control`, `cohort_person_time`,
  `cohort_time_to_event`), with spaces or hyphens in place of
  underscores. Synonyms such as `"prevalence"`, `"risk"`, `"rate"`, and
  `"survival"` are rejected.
- `register_measure()`, `register_rule()`, `list_measures()`, and
  `list_rules()` are now internal. The public extension API is
  [`register_engine()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/register_engine.md),
  [`register_journal()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/register_journal.md),
  [`list_engines()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/list_engines.md),
  and
  [`list_journals()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/list_journals.md).
- The advice rule set shrinks from 46 to 37 rules. Rules for removed
  features are gone, `fisher_low_expected` is folded into
  `small_expected_cells`, and `normality_heuristic_large_n` into
  `continuous_test_stat_choice`. The ruleset version is now
  `downscale-2026-09-23`.
- Removed the `migration-3-0` and `simtablr-for-spss-stata-users`
  vignettes; a short SPSS/Stata orientation now lives in the
  getting-started guide.

#### Earlier 3.1 changes

- Removed `register_test()` and `list_tests()`. The comparison-test
  registry only stored functions; no engine ever dispatched to a
  registered test. Built-in tests are selected with
  [`test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/test.md)
  / `test =` as before.

- Stratified
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  PR/OR no longer prints the one-off “additive change” message about
  Mantel-Haenszel pooling.

- Renamed two exported verbs that masked **dplyr** generics when both
  packages were attached. `compute()` is now
  [`evaluate()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/evaluate.md)
  and `explain()` is now
  [`why()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/why.md);
  the S3 methods move with them (`why.simtab_spec()`,
  `why.simtab_result()`, `why.simtab_report()`). Behaviour is unchanged.
  No compatibility aliases are provided, so attaching SimtablR no longer
  masks any dplyr export. The engine contract keeps its `compute` field:
  `register_engine(compute = ...)` is unaffected.

- **Named change.** Adjusted PR/RR on data that previously reached the
  modified Poisson fallback may now report a log-binomial estimate
  instead, and the number changes. **Old behaviour:**
  [`stats::glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html) has no usable
  default initialization for a log link on a binomial family; it aborts
  before the first iteration with “no valid set of coefficients has been
  found”. SimtablR recorded that as a convergence failure and
  substituted modified Poisson. **New behaviour:** when, and only when,
  the unseeded fit produces no model at all, the log-binomial is retried
  with the conventional starting values (intercept at the marginal log
  risk, slopes at zero) and its estimate is reported if it converges. On
  `epitabl`, the adjusted renal-impairment RR for 365-day MACE moves
  from 1.825 (robust Poisson) to 1.771 (log-binomial), matching a
  hand-fitted [`stats::glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html).
  **Scope:** a model that already fitted keeps its exact numerical path
  and its estimates are unchanged; the retry fires only where the
  previous result came from an unrecoverable fit.

- `flextable` and `openxlsx` moved from Imports to Suggests, and `dplyr`
  was removed from Imports (it is retained only as a test-only Suggests,
  for the regression test that keeps the `summarise()` unmasking
  guarantee honest). This cuts the recursive non-base dependency
  footprint from 62 packages to 12. Every affected entry point already
  checked for its backend at runtime and continues to raise the classed
  `simtab_error_dependency` with installation guidance, so
  `as_flextable()`, `simtab_theme()`,
  [`export_docx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_docx.md),
  [`export_pptx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_pptx.md),
  [`export_xlsx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_xlsx.md),
  [`export_regtab_xlsx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_regtab_xlsx.md),
  and the journal-style flextable themes now require an explicit
  [`install.packages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html)
  on a minimal installation. Computing, printing,
  [`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html),
  `tidy()`, `glance()`,
  [`as_gt()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/as_gt.md),
  methods prose, and reproducibility manifests are unaffected. `dplyr`
  was imported only for a `%>%` that no code in the package used and
  that was never re-exported, so its removal has no user-visible effect.

### Compliance remediation and release infrastructure

- Diagnostic LR+ and LR- now retain mathematical `Inf` when a positive
  numerator is divided by zero; an indeterminate zero-over-zero remains
  `NA`. Raw evidence stays numeric, while renderers and machine exports
  handle the boundary at the presentation edge.
- Every public file writer now adds an omitted suffix, rejects an
  incompatible suffix, protects an existing destination by default, and
  replaces it only with `overwrite = TRUE` through a same-directory
  transactional write.
- Regression and Cox results implement
  [`coef()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/coef.html),
  [`confint()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/confint.html),
  [`formula()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/formula.html),
  [`nobs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/nobs.html), and
  [`vcov()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/vcov.html) over copied model
  evidence.
  [`model_info()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/model_info.md)
  reports convergence and per-outcome failures without exposing mutable
  fitted models.
- Added deterministic edge-case tests, opt-in multi-seed and scaling
  tests via `SIMTABLR_EXTENDED_TESTS=true`, unmodified-project coverage
  reporting, and an executable documentation contract. Advice rules are
  split into table, regression, ROC, data-quality, and reviewer families
  without changing their IDs, order, wording, deduplication, or
  non-blocking behavior.
- Added contributor guidance, a Code of Conduct, package citation
  metadata, statistical scope and lifecycle statements, and expanded
  references, assumptions, edge behavior, interpretation, and runnable
  examples for the major analysis and grammar interfaces.
- ROC plots now distinguish groups with both a discrete viridis palette
  and line type, improving accessibility without changing their stored
  numerical evidence.

### Correctness and honest output

- A log-binomial model that could not be fitted and one that was fitted
  and failed to converge are now reported as the different findings they
  are. Advice and
  [`as_methods()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/as_methods.md)
  prose say “the log-binomial model could not be fitted” for the first
  and keep “did not converge” for the second, instead of describing
  every fallback as non-convergence. The distinction is recorded in
  result metadata as `logbinomial_status`.

- Naming a built-in measure that a descriptive or bivariate table cannot
  compute now names the function that can: `"hr"` points to
  [`survtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/survtab.md)
  and `"auc"` to
  [`roc()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/roc.md).
  The previous advice — “register the measure with a supported
  estimator” — was not actionable, because all of these measures are
  already registered.

- The advice raised when a declared `cohort_person_time` or
  `cohort_time_to_event` design resolves no effect measure now names the
  engine and entry point that would estimate it, and no longer describes
  the survival engine as unavailable.
  [`survtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/survtab.md)
  has resolved HR since 3.1.0; the message was left over from drafting.

- **Named change.** A
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  adjusted effect whose model failed to converge now raises the rung-4
  `adjusted_effect_not_converged` advice rule. **Old behaviour:** the
  engine recorded `effect_converged = FALSE` but nothing read it, so a
  separated model printed an estimate such as
  `1.19e23 (8.27e22 - 1.71e23)` under an “Adjusted OR (95% CI)” heading
  with no warning. **New behaviour:** the reader is told the estimate is
  not trustworthy. **Why:**
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md)
  already warned on separation; the descriptive adjusted path did not.
  Healthy models are unaffected.

- [`survtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/survtab.md)
  rejects a zero-event cohort with a classed `simtab_error_engine`
  instead of failing inside `cox.zph()` with an error naming the
  engine’s own locals. The proportional-hazards diagnostic is now
  computed defensively, so a degenerate diagnostic cannot discard the
  fit.

- An all-missing `event` column is rejected with a classed binding error
  rather than passing the 0/1 check vacuously and failing later in base
  R.

- **Named change.**
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md) no
  longer presents an unadjusted p-value as adjusted. **Old behaviour:**
  the column was relabelled “Adjusted P-value” and `$data$tests`
  recorded the method, but a
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  table holds a single p-value and every method is the identity on a
  family of one, so the number never changed. **New behaviour:** the
  argument warns that it was ignored and the display stays unadjusted.
  **Escape hatch:** `table1(...) |> test(p.adjust =)` adjusts a real
  family of p-values across variables.

- [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  warns instead of silently returning nothing when a requested effect
  measure cannot be estimated - an outcome with fewer than two observed
  levels, or a stratified request with fewer than two usable strata -
  and names the reason. The empty column previously read as “no
  association”.

- [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  announces which outcome level a ratio measure scores as the event when
  the outcome has more than two levels, instead of silently collapsing
  to “last level versus the rest”.

- [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  drops the grouping variable from its own `adjust` set with a warning.
  Adjusting an effect for its own outcome is degenerate and reported an
  odds ratio of exactly 1.00 (1.00 - 1.00) from a model that never
  converged.

- p-value boundaries print at the precision the boundary itself needs:
  the default `pval_thresh = 0.001` rendered as `"<0.00"` at
  `pval_digits = 2` and `"<0"` at `pval_digits = 0`.

- [`label()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/label.md)
  accepts a named character vector passed positionally
  (`label(x, c(age = "Age"))`), the form `table1(labels =)` and
  `fmt(labels =)` already take; it previously reported the inner names
  as missing.

- The
  [`sensitivity()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/sensitivity.md)
  “requires at least one named variation” error suggested
  `denominator("complete")`, a function that does not exist, under a
  variation name the code rejects. It now names the supported
  shorthands.

- The
  [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md)
  methods sentence starts capitalised.

- [`repro_manifest()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/repro_manifest.md)
  gains `design_used`, a logical distinguishing a design that actually
  resolved `measure` (`resolved_from == "design"`) from a design that is
  merely recorded (for example a
  [`set_design()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/set_design.md)
  data-frame attribute that is never consulted by resolution). **Old
  behaviour:** the manifest reported `design = "cohort"` alongside
  `measure = NULL` with no way to tell the design took no part in
  computation. **New behaviour:** `design_used` makes that explicit, and
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) on the manifest notes
  it. `design` and `design_source` are unchanged. Added an exported
  [`design()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/design.md)
  accessor so callers no longer need to read the internal
  `"simtablr.design"` attribute directly;
  [`set_design()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/set_design.md)’s
  documentation now states explicitly that the data-frame form is
  advisory-only and does not itself resolve an effect measure
  (resolution has always required `design =` on the call or
  [`set_design()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/set_design.md)
  on a `simtab_spec` - this is a documentation and manifest fix, not a
  change to resolution behaviour).

- Fixed `vignettes/study-design-effect-measures.Rmd`, which read the
  wrong internal attribute name (`"simtab_design"` instead of
  `"simtablr.design"`, always printing `NULL`) and then demonstrated
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)/[`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  calls that, under the always-advisory data-frame design contract
  above, silently never resolved the effect measure the surrounding
  prose claimed. The vignette now uses the
  [`design()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/design.md)
  accessor and passes `design =` explicitly where a measure is meant to
  resolve.

- Added an
  [`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html) method
  for audit results, which previously failed with a generic “cannot
  coerce class” error. `as.data.frame(advise(result, audit = TRUE))`
  returns the checked-rules table with a `fired` logical column.
  [`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html) on a
  general `simtab_report` (for example
  [`simtablr()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/simtablr.md)’s
  output) returns a named list of per-item data.frames, mirroring the
  existing
  [`as_gt()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/as_gt.md)/`as_flextable()`
  behaviour for reports whose items are not all the same shape.

- `print.simtab_audit()` (`advise(audit = TRUE)` output) now wraps its
  `Message`/`Citation`/`Fix` fields to `getOption("width")` instead of
  printing lines up to 160 characters wide regardless of console width.

- `print.simtab_regtab()` no longer splits a narrow console’s output
  into disconnected vertical column blocks (base `print.data.frame`’s
  behaviour when a table is wider than `options(width)`). Each row now
  always prints on one line; the `Variable` label is abbreviated with an
  ellipsis when the console is too narrow to show it in full, rather
  than letting a term’s label and its estimate land in separate,
  unlabelled blocks. \## Advanced visualization

- **Named change.** Forest plots now resolve their axis from the effect
  measure instead of always using a log axis. Ratio measures (OR, RR,
  PR, HR, IRR) keep the log axis with the null at 1; difference-scale
  quantities - including `regtab(exponentiate = FALSE)` coefficients -
  now use a linear axis with the null at 0. **Old behaviour:** every
  estimate was forced onto a log scale and any estimate at or below zero
  was silently dropped from the plot. **New behaviour:** those estimates
  are plotted. **Why:** a negative log-odds coefficient is a legitimate
  estimate, and silently omitting it misrepresented the model. **Escape
  hatch:** plot an exponentiated result to keep the ratio presentation.

- `autoplot()` now works on
  [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md)
  results, drawing either the stored confusion matrix
  (`type = "matrix"`, default) or sensitivity, specificity, and
  predictive values as points with their stored confidence intervals
  (`type = "metrics"`). Calibration curves are deliberately not offered:
  a binary index test provides no risk scale to calibrate. The existing
  base
  [`plot.simtab_diag()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/plot.simtab_diag.md)
  fourfold display is unchanged.

- SimtablR plots now carry the canvas size that suits them - a forest
  plot grows with its row count. The new
  [`export_plot()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_plot.md)
  honours that recommendation, while explicit `width`/`height` arguments
  always override.

### Error reporting

- Added the `simtab_error_input` condition class for invalid arguments
  at a public entry point, alongside the existing
  `simtab_error_binding`, `simtab_error_spec`, `simtab_error_engine`,
  `simtab_error_flag`, and `simtab_error_render` classes. Input
  validation in
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md),
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md),
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md),
  [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md),
  [`roc()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/roc.md),
  and
  [`survtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/survtab.md)
  now raises classed conditions with the house `x`/`i`/`v` layout rather
  than bare [`stop()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/stop.html) calls.
  **Message text has changed**; assert on the condition class rather
  than on prose.
- SimtablR condition helpers now evaluate
  [`{}`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Paren.html) expressions in the calling
  function’s environment, so error messages can interpolate the
  offending value directly.
- Added the `simtab_error_dependency` class, raised when a suggested
  package is needed but not installed.
- **Named change.** Every error the package raises now carries a
  SimtablR condition class. **Old behaviour:** roughly 160 validation
  failures used bare [`stop()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/stop.html), so
  the only way to test for them was to match their prose. **New
  behaviour:** each one raises a classed condition with the house
  `x`/`i`/`v` layout. **Why:** a message is not an API; a class is.
  **Migration:** message text has changed throughout - assert on the
  class (`expect_error(..., class = "simtab_error_input")`) rather than
  on wording. Note that `cli` renders argument names with backticks, so
  patterns matching the old `'arg'` quoting no longer match. The single
  remaining bare [`stop()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/stop.html) is in the
  autocomplete handler, where erroring is how the completer declines a
  token rather than a failure the user sees; a regression test keeps it
  the only one.

### Statistical corrections

- Diagnostic likelihood ratios now distinguish a defined infinite
  boundary from an undefined ratio.
  [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md)
  returns `Inf` for LR+ or LR- when a positive numerator is divided by
  zero, and retains `NA` for zero divided by zero. Raw result and tidy
  values remain numeric; display and spreadsheet renderers represent
  infinity only at the presentation edge.

### Export safety

- **Named change.** All public file writers now protect existing files
  by default.
  [`export_docx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_docx.md),
  [`export_pptx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_pptx.md),
  [`export_xlsx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_xlsx.md),
  [`export_regtab_csv()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_regtab_csv.md),
  [`export_regtab_xlsx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_regtab_xlsx.md),
  and
  [`export_plot()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_plot.md)
  require `overwrite = TRUE` before replacing a destination. Missing
  format suffixes are added (`.png` is the plot default), while
  incompatible suffixes raise `simtab_error_export`.
- File writers create a same-directory temporary artifact and publish it
  only after the backend succeeds. A failed write removes the temporary
  artifact and leaves any existing destination untouched. This
  intentionally replaces the former backend-dependent, sometimes silent
  overwrite behaviour.

### Regression interoperability

- [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md)
  and
  [`survtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/survtab.md)
  results now support [`coef()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/coef.html),
  [`confint()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/confint.html),
  [`formula()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/formula.html),
  [`nobs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/nobs.html), and
  [`vcov()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/vcov.html) over copied, link-scale
  model evidence. Single-outcome results return conventional values;
  multi-outcome results return predictably named collections, and
  `outcome =` selects one model. Unknown, ambiguous, or failed
  selections raise `simtab_error_model`.
- Added
  [`model_info()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/model_info.md)
  for stable convergence, boundary, failure, sample-size, and event
  information. SimtablR still does not expose mutable fitted-model
  objects, fitted values, residuals, prediction, or forecasting; users
  needing those workflows should fit the underlying model package
  directly.

### Autocomplete is now RStudio-only

- **Named change.** `simtab_completions(TRUE)` installs the SimtablR
  completer in RStudio only. **Old behaviour:** the completer was
  installed on any front end, and on Rterm or radian it handed
  unrecognised tokens back to R’s own completion machinery. **New
  behaviour:** outside RStudio it declines to install, says why, and
  leaves `rc.options(custom.completer)` untouched. **Why:** handing a
  token back required calling an unexported `utils` function, which a
  CRAN package may not do; the alternative - installing anyway - would
  have left every non-SimtablR token with no completions at all.
  **Escape hatch:** none needed; declining changes nothing about how
  SimtablR itself behaves, and completion in unsupported hosts works
  exactly as it did before the completer existed.
- The reported `mode` is now `"throw"` or `"unsupported"`; the former
  `"delegate"` mode has been removed.

### Default-resolution hardening

- The 2x2 routing guard is now an exact `identical(dim(tab), c(2L, 2L))`
  check rather than `all(dim(tab) == c(2, 2))`, which recycled silently
  against higher-dimensional arrays. Tables with non-finite counts are
  also excluded. Numbers are unchanged for genuine 2x2 tables.
- [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  now documents its display-denominator convention explicitly:
  percentages for observed categories use the non-missing denominator,
  the “Missing” row reports a raw count rather than a percentage of the
  column total, and association tests are identical whether or not
  missingness is displayed.

### Extension and reproducibility infrastructure

- Added the public evidence verb
  [`engine()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/engine.md).
  Registered engines can now be selected on either a `simtab_spec` or a
  computed `simtab_result`; result edits recompute through the shared
  verb-closure path and retain data-drift warnings.
- `digest` is now an imported dependency. Captured-data fingerprints and
  reproducibility manifests always use and identify `xxhash64`; the
  former weak fallback fingerprint has been removed.

### `set_summary()` replaces the conflicting `summarise()` builder verb

- This is an intentional breaking API change: use `set_summary("mean")`,
  `set_summary("median")`, or `set_summary("auto")` when configuring a
  SimtablR specification or result. SimtablR’s former `summarise()`
  generic has been removed completely, including its export and S3
  methods.
- The rename prevents SimtablR from masking
  [`dplyr::summarise()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html).
  Previously, attaching SimtablR after dplyr broke ordinary data-frame
  summaries, while attaching dplyr after SimtablR broke SimtablR’s
  builder dispatch.

### Numeric-coded categorical variables are now auto-detected

- [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md) and
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  no longer summarise every numeric column as continuous. A numeric
  variable is now treated as categorical when all its non-missing values
  are whole numbers and either exactly two distinct values exist (0/1
  dummies, 1/2 sex codes – at any sample size) or at most seven distinct
  values exist with at least 20 non-missing observations (Likert-type
  codes). This boundary matches the existing `ordinal_as_continuous`
  advice rule, so the default detection now agrees with the package’s
  own advice.
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  announces the automatic choice with a message, and `var.type`
  overrides it in either direction.
- [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  gains a `var.type` argument (scalar or per-variable named vector),
  matching
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md), as
  the escape hatch for the new default.
- Integer codes with many levels (e.g. numeric study-site or project
  IDs) are still detected as continuous – no cardinality threshold can
  separate them from genuine counts. Convert such columns with
  [`factor()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html) or pass
  `var.type = "categorical"`.
- Regression machinery
  ([`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md),
  adjusted effects, `focus` terms) keeps the strict
  numeric-means-continuous rule, so model terms and estimates are
  unchanged.

## SimtablR 3.0.0

SimtablR 3.0.0 is a major release and a deliberate clean break from the
2.x series. It reorganises the package around a single grammar of table
specifications and immutable result objects, adds survival/Firth/E-value
engines, a suite of workflow verbs, and aligns several statistical
defaults with current epidemiological practice. See
`vignette("migration-3-0")` for a full migration guide with the escape
hatch for every changed default that has one (three of the changes are
correctness fixes with no escape hatch by design).

### Progressive advice display

- Automatic advice now uses one grouped `cli` message callout per result
  or report, ordered from highest to lowest severity. The concise prose
  omits internal rule IDs, rung labels, `Fix:` prefixes, and
  SimtablR-internal citations while preserving the complete structured
  advice record.
- The default profile shows severity 3–4 advice and reports how many
  severity 1–2 notes are hidden. The new `important` profile shows
  severity 3–4 only; `quiet` is now its compatibility alias, correcting
  the previous behavior that retained only severity 1 advice. `teaching`
  shows all non-audit advice with external citations and rationale,
  while `strict` shows it in compact prose.
- Advice display can be disabled with `simtablr_guidance("off")`,
  standard [`suppressMessages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/message.html),
  or knitr’s `message = FALSE`; stored advice is unchanged.
- Advice now prints as one titled `cli` callout: a warning heading when
  any displayed entry has severity 3–4, and an information heading
  otherwise. Each callout shows only one action hint. Guidance hints now
  explain that
  [`simtablr_guidance()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/simtablr_guidance.md)
  is run separately before printing, and misplaced calls inside
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  or [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  receive a targeted error.
- When a result has only one non-audit advice entry, the entry itself is
  now shown under every guidance profile except `"off"`; it is no longer
  replaced by a singular hidden-note count.

### Compact result printing

- `table1` and `regtab` results now print the table without their
  decorative summary and `Call:` lines by default. Use
  `print(x, details = TRUE)` to restore both. Stored calls, report item
  headings, exports, and other engine printers are unchanged.

### Breaking changes

#### Result classes were renamed

- Every result now carries a namespaced `simtab_*` class first, so
  SimtablR’s S3 methods dispatch only on names it owns:
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md) -\>
  `c("simtab_tb", "tb", "simtab_result", "simtab")`,
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md)
  -\> `c("simtab_regtab", "regtab", ...)`,
  [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md)
  -\> `c("simtab_diag", "diag_test", ...)`,
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  -\> `c("simtab_table1", "simtab_result", "simtab")`,
  [`roc()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/roc.md)
  -\> `c("simtab_roc", "simtab_result", "simtab")`.
- The bare legacy tags `tb`, `regtab`, and `diag_test` are **kept** for
  users’ [`inherits()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/class.html) checks. The
  bare tags `table1` and `roc` are **dropped** because they collide with
  the CRAN `table1` package and
  [`pROC::roc`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/pROC/man/roc.html). Test the preset
  with `is_simtab(x, "table1")` / `is_simtab(x, "roc")` instead of
  [`inherits()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/class.html).

#### The `p` flag was reassigned

- Bare `p` now **adds the p-value column** (equivalent to
  `test = TRUE`); it no longer means “percentage”. Use the new `perc`
  alias, or the canonical `cell` flag, for total/cell percentages. The
  first `p` use per session prints a one-time migration note.

#### Aligned statistical defaults (numbers may move)

The defaults below changed; each has an escape hatch (except the
correctness fixes, which have none by design), tabulated under “Your
numbers may move” at the end of this section.

- 2x2 chi-squared tests in
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md) and
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  now use the N-1 chi-squared statistic recommended by Campbell (2007),
  replacing base Pearson/Yates output for 2x2 tables; larger r x c
  tables still use classical Pearson chi-squared. Escape:
  `test = "fisher"` for an exact test.
- Automatic 2x2 test selection now follows Campbell’s expected-cell
  boundary: `test = TRUE` uses Fisher-Irwin only when any expected cell
  is below 1, and keeps N-1 chi-squared otherwise (with educator advice
  when expected cells are between 1 and 5). This retires the previous
  expected-counts-below-5 Fisher auto-switch. Escape: `test = "fisher"`
  or `test = "chisq"`.
- Adjusted PR/RR estimates now try log-binomial regression first and
  fall back to modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors
  only when log-binomial does not converge. The estimator used is
  recorded in result metadata, announced when substituted, and reflected
  in
  [`as_methods()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/as_methods.md)
  prose.
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md)
  remains family-driven and is not rerouted. Escape: none needed – the
  fallback reproduces the previous robust-Poisson estimate exactly.
- Continuous summaries now default to `summary = "auto"` in
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  and `stat.cont = "auto"` in
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md),
  using complete-case N and skewness bands from Ghasemi &
  Zahediasl (2012) to choose mean (SD) for approximately symmetric
  variables and median (IQR) otherwise. Escape: `summary = "median"` /
  `"mean"` or `stat.cont = "median"` / `"mean"`.
- [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  now shows per-variable Missing rows by default, aligning descriptive
  tables with STROBE item 14.
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  remains opt-in via `m = TRUE` or the `miss` flag. Escape:
  `missing = FALSE` or `missingness(display = FALSE)`.
- Crude Prevalence/Risk Ratio (Katz) and Odds Ratio (Woolf) calculations
  now apply a Haldane-Anscombe +0.5 continuity correction to all four
  cells of a 2x2 comparison when any cell is zero, instead of returning
  `NA`. The correction is announced via a rung-1 `zero_cell_correction`
  educator rule. Affects only rows with a zero cell.

#### Deprecations

- The bare flag aliases `rp` (-\> `pr`) and `m` (-\> `miss`) are
  soft-deprecated and warn once per session; they are slated for removal
  in 3.1.

### New engines and workflow verbs

- Added
  [`survtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/survtab.md)
  for Cox proportional hazards tables and `km()` for Kaplan-Meier
  summaries (via the `survival` package), with KM `autoplot()`, survival
  `tidy()`/`glance()`/[`as_methods()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/as_methods.md)
  renderers, log-rank tests, Schoenfeld PH checks, and graceful install
  guidance. The design resolver now selects HR for cohort analyses with
  time and event roles.
- Added `regtab(method = "firth")` for Firth penalised binomial-logit
  models (via `logistf`), including profile-penalised confidence
  intervals, methods prose, and separation advice pointing to a
  one-click refit.
- Added
  [`e_value()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/e_value.md)
  for native VanderWeele-Ding E-values from ratio estimates, with OR/HR
  approximation flags.
- Added `subgroups()` to recompute an existing effect result within
  levels of a subgroup variable, returning a `simtab_report`, reporting
  Breslow-Day or interaction-LRT heterogeneity, rendering a subgroup
  forest, and emitting subgroup-credibility/multiplicity advice.
- Added
  [`sensitivity()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/sensitivity.md)
  to re-estimate a result under named variations (`measure`,
  `denominator`, …) and
  [`flow()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/flow.md)
  to record the analytic sample as a participant-flow object.
- Added `explain()` and
  [`as_methods()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/as_methods.md)
  (now covering every engine) to narrate the analytic decisions and
  write the methods sentence from the result itself.
- Added
  [`strobe()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/strobe.md)
  /
  [`stard()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/stard.md)
  reporting-checklist objects (classed, with their own print method;
  they advise, they never grade or block) and
  [`codebook()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/codebook.md)
  for a one-row-per-variable data dictionary.
- Added a classed error taxonomy – `simtab_error_binding`, `_spec`,
  `_engine`, `_render`, `_flag`, all inheriting `simtab_error` –
  documented at
  [`?simtab_errors`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/simtab_errors.md),
  so callers can catch failures by class.

### Language and grammar

- Added the shared terse flag vocabulary `row`, `col`, `cell`, `or`,
  `pr`, `rr`, `p`, and `miss`, enabled on both
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md) and
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  ([`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  reads flags from `...` after `by`; unknown dots error as likely
  typos). `perc` is a quiet alias for `cell` in
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  because it reads better for univariate percentages. Named `measure =`
  and `test =` arguments always override flags; flags apply
  left-to-right.
- Unified the binding idiom: bare names, quoted strings, and tidyselect
  helpers (`all_of()`, `starts_with()`) route through one path on every
  preset. Existing string-based code keeps working unchanged.
- Added the
  [`simtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/simtab.md)
  builder and setter verbs; built-in presets desugar through the verbs,
  and every setter verb has a `simtab_result` method (verb closure) that
  re-estimates via one shared recompute helper over the result’s
  captured data.
- Added the extension registry:
  [`register_engine()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/register_engine.md),
  `register_measure()`, `register_test()`,
  [`register_journal()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/register_journal.md),
  `register_rule()`, each with a `list_*()` reader. A registered engine
  reaches full method dispatch with zero edits to SimtablR (see
  `vignette("customizing-extending")`).

### Statistical methods

- Added forest-plot rendering for effect-carrying
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md),
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md),
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md),
  and Cox results via engine-local `autoplot` renderers; forest data are
  built from raw effect numerics and are invariant to
  restyling/rounding.
- [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md)
  now computes native GVIF/VIF-equivalent diagnostics for
  multi-predictor models, matching pinned
  [`car::vif()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/car/man/vif.html) references
  without adding `car` as a dependency. Default printed/tidy/display
  tables are unchanged; request VIF via `as.data.frame(fit, vif = TRUE)`
  or `generics::glance(fit, vif = TRUE)`. Advice flags VIF above 5 and
  escalates above 10; single-predictor models stay silent.
- `regtab(robust = )` now accepts `"HC0"`, `"HC1"`, `"HC2"`, `"HC3"`, or
  `"none"` in addition to `TRUE`/`FALSE`. A rung-2 `hc0_small_n`
  educator rule suggests `robust = "HC3"` at N \< 100 (Long & Ervin,
  2000).
- `check()`/`audit()` now includes a standing, severity-0
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md)
  prompt asking whether predictors were pre-specified (formula
  provenance cannot detect stepwise selection), and a rung-2
  `many_predictors_no_design` rule fires when a
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md)
  formula has more than 10 predictor terms and no design was stated.
- Added data-shape educator rules that inspect the described variable(s)
  directly: `id_like_column`, `constant_column`,
  `high_cardinality_factor`, `ordinal_as_continuous`,
  `date_column_described`, `repeated_ids_independence`,
  `overdispersion_poisson`, `forced_mean_skewed`, and
  `tiny_denominator_pct`.
- Added survival educator rules `cox_ph_violation` (rung 4) and
  `km_median_unreached` (rung 1).

### Corrections

- [`export_docx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_docx.md),
  [`export_pptx()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/export_pptx.md),
  and `as_flextable()` now work for **every** engine result –
  [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md),
  [`rbind()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cbind.html)-stacked tables,
  [`diag_test()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/diag_test.md),
  [`regtab()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/regtab.md),
  [`roc()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/roc.md),
  and the survival tables – and accept the documented `footnotes`
  argument. Previously only
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md)
  results exported; every other engine’s `as_flextable()` renderer
  forwarded `footnotes` into
  [`flextable::flextable()`](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/reference/flextable.html)
  and errored with `unused argument (footnotes = NULL)`.
- The Mantel-Haenszel pooled **risk-ratio confidence interval** now uses
  the Greenland-Robins (1985) variance estimator, gate-checked against
  `epiR` and the longhand formula. Earlier drafts used an incorrect
  variance; stratified PR/RR confidence intervals (from
  `tb(..., strat = )` and `subgroups()`) become wider and correct. The
  point estimate is unchanged.
- [`tb()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/tb.md)
  combined with the missing-display flag (`miss`/`m`) **and** an effect
  measure or the p-value now computes the effect ratios and the
  association test on complete cases, exactly as it does without the
  flag. Previously the flag’s `<NA>` display column was mistaken for the
  outcome’s event column, so `tb(data, exposure, outcome, or, miss)`
  reported a wrong odds/risk ratio plus a spurious `<NA>` effect row,
  and `tb(data, exposure, outcome, p, miss)` returned a corrupted
  chi-squared test (df = 4, `NaN`). The missing category is still shown
  in the frequency/percentage display; only the statistics are now
  complete-case, matching
  [`table1()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/table1.md).
- [`sensitivity()`](https://MatheusTG-14.github.io/SimtablR/reference/sensitivity.md)
  now reports the actual effect estimate for each variation instead of
  the reference row. Previously the headline extractor filtered
  reference rows with [`isTRUE()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html) on
  a whole logical column, which collapses to a single `FALSE` and never
  removed the reference row, so every variation reported `estimate = 1`
  with missing confidence limits regardless of the true effect.

## SimtablR 2.0.0

### Major Changes

#### tb() Function

*Overhauled tb() to return a structured list. The object inherits the S3
class vector c(“tb”, “simtab”). Matrices with attributes are no longer
returned directly from the primary function loop.* Ratio Schema
Standardization: Renamed fields within the internal ratios data frame to
lower_ci and upper_ci to establish strict compatibility with
multivariable regression tables (regtab()). *Simplified Continuous
Syntax: Enhanced var.type parsing to accept an unnamed scalar character
string shorthand (e.g., var.type = “continuous”) and map it
automatically to the main row variable. \#### New Features* Table
Stacking (rbind.tb): Implemented the rbind.tb() S3 method to support the
vertical stacking of discrete tb objects sharing the same column
variables. *Dual Export Modes: Expanded as.data.frame.tb() and
as.data.frame.rbind_tb() to support a tidy toggle. tidy = FALSE
(default) provides display-ready character strings for manuscripts,
while tidy = TRUE returns unformatted numeric data frames optimized for
ggplot2 workflows.* RStudio Autocomplete Replacement: Integrated an
unexported interactive completion replacement hook inside zzz.R using
.rs.registerAutocompleteReplacement() to dynamically expose dataset
column names inside RStudio console environments. *Wald-Aligned Ratio
Statistics: Upgraded unadjusted Prevalence Ratio (PR) and Odds Ratio
(OR) calculations to compute Wald z-score p-values aligned directly
alongside confidence intervals.* Added new runtime educational message()
notifications that fire automatically under specific conditions *Added
explicit registerS3method() entries for rbind, print, and as.data.frame
generics within .onLoad() to guarantee stable dispatch across
development environments, source routines, and unattached package
builds. \#### Other changes* Fixed a vulnerability where common column
names (like p or col) matching formatting flags were silently
intercepted by the NSE symbol parser. \*Extracted all text formatting,
cell stitching matrices, margin additions, and string template
processing out of core workflows and isolated them within a unified
internal builder called .build_display_matrix().
